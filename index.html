The Tapers' Manifesto
(Published on May 4, 2025, v1.0)

"We are the guardians of sound, the keepers of the moment. Every note is sacred, every performance immortal."

1. We are the chroniclers of live sound.
   We don’t record for profit — we preserve. We document. We share.

2. Music is not a commodity.
   It is a moment, alive and fleeting — not a product. We reject its exploitation.

3. We honor imperfection.
   The hiss, the cheers, the off-key note — these are the truths of live sound. They matter.

4. The crowd, the room, the breath between notes — these are part of the art.
   We don’t just record performances. We capture environments.

5. Taping is not piracy. It is preservation.
   We are cultural archivists, not thieves.

6. We reject the ownership model of sound.
   Music should not be fenced in. It lives through being shared.

7. Every tape is resistance.
   To record is to defy the gatekeepers of access.

8. We share. We do not sell.
   Taping is a gift — from taper to listener. No price tag required.

9. The tape is proof.
   It proves the music happened. That we were there. That it mattered.

10. Taping is personal.
    It’s passion, not business. A commitment, not a transaction.

11. We seek no fame, no fortune.
    Our reward is memory — preserved, protected, passed on.

12. We reject music industry elitism.
    Sound is not for sale. Music is not for moguls. It belongs to everyone.

13. The mainstream is irrelevant.
    The underground thrives without approval.

14. The internet is our amplifier.
    The web is where tapes live and speak freely.

15. This manifesto speaks for one.
    I do not claim to represent all tapers. I speak with love, not authority.

16. Join the quiet revolution.
    Tape. Preserve. Share. Refuse to forget.
