The Tapers' Manifesto
(Published on May 4, 2025, v1.0)

"We are the guardians of sound, the keepers of the moment. Every note is sacred, every performance immortal."

1. We are the chroniclers of live sound.
   We do not profit from what we record. We preserve. We share.

2. Music is not a commodity.
   It is a living entity, a fleeting moment that exists to be experienced, not bought and sold. We reject the idea that music should be monetized for personal gain.

3. We embrace the raw, unpolished sound of live performances.
   Every imperfection is a part of the performance, and in these flaws, we find the true essence of music.

4. The sound of the crowd, the echo in the hall, the energy of the moment – all are equally important.
   We do not just capture the band, we capture the connection between the performer and the audience, the shared experience of live music.

5. Taping is not piracy; it is preservation.
   We are not thieves; we are archivists of culture, ensuring that the music of today is preserved for tomorrow.

6. We reject the commodification of music.
   Music should not be bound by the chains of commerce. It is free, for all to enjoy, experience, and share.

7. Every tape, every recording is an act of rebellion.
   We refuse to be part of a system that restricts access to music. We fight for the freedom to record, to share, and to experience music on our own terms.

8. We share, we do not sell.
   The value of music lies not in its price tag but in the shared experience, the community that forms around it. Our goal is to spread, not to profit.

9. The tape is a document of rebellion.
   It is a reminder that live music belongs to everyone. It belongs to the fans, the creators, and the community, not the corporations.

10. The act of taping is personal.
    It is an act of devotion to the music, a dedication to ensuring that the energy of the performance is never lost.

11. We are not interested in fame or fortune.
    The true reward comes from the music itself, from the freedom to tape, and from knowing that we are preserving a moment that would otherwise be lost to time.

12. We reject the elitism of the music industry.
    Music should not be a privilege for the rich and powerful. It should be accessible to all, at all times, and in all forms.

13. We do not need the approval of the mainstream.
    The mainstream is irrelevant. The real value is in the underground, in the shared moments between artists and their fans, in the tapes that circulate far from the reach of record executives.

14. The internet is our amplifier.
    The web is where the tapes live, where the music spreads, where the revolution is broadcast to the world.

15. Our manifesto is not just for tapers; it is for everyone who believes that music is a free, living thing.
    We fight for music, for sound, for the experience of a live performance to be accessible to all, not just the privileged few.

16. Join the revolution.
    The time is now. We must preserve, share, and ensure that live music will continue to be available to all.
