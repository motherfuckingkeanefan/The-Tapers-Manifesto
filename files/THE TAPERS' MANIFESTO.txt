THE TAPERS' MANIFESTO

Listen up. Tapers — the dedicated, sound-chasing pioneers — are the guardians of music history.
Without us, some of the greatest moments in music would fade into thin obscurity.

WHY TAPERS MATTER

- Because live music isn't meant to end the second the amps go quiet.
- Because artists create magic, and someone has to capture it.
- Because memories fade, but tapes don’t.
- Because nobody else will do it right — not labels, not TikTok, not corporations.

WHAT WE DO

We haul gear through rain, sweat, and challenging venues.
We battle bad acoustics, enthusiastic crowds, and security guards.
We hit RECORD when it matters most.
We document history one show, one night, one raw moment at a time.

IN CONCLUSION

If you're a taper, you’re not just recording.
You’re preserving culture.
You’re a guardian of live music history.
Stand proud. Stand together. Tape it or lose it forever.

RESPECT THE TAPE.
RESPECT THE TAPER.
YES.
