THE TAPERS' MANIFESTO

Listen up.
Tapers — the mic-hauling, sound-chasing maniacs — are the goddamn historians of music.
Without us, half the greatest nights ever played would vanish into thin fucking air.

WHY TAPERS MATTER

- Because live music isn't meant to die the second the amps go quiet.
- Because artists create magic, and someone has to fucking capture it.
- Because memories fade, but tapes don’t.
- Because nobody else will do it right — not labels, not TikTok idiots, not corporations.

WHAT WE DO

We haul gear through rain, sweat, and shitty venues.
We battle bad acoustics, idiot crowds, and security guards.
We hit RECORD when it matters most.
We document history one show, one night, one raw fucking moment at a time.

IN CONCLUSION

If you're a taper, you’re not just recording.
You’re preserving culture.
You’re a guardian of live music history.
Stand proud. Stand loud. Tape it or lose it forever.

RESPECT THE TAPE.
RESPECT THE TAPER.
FUCK YES.
