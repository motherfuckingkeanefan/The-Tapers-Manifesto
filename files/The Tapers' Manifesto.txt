
The Tapers' Manifesto
=====================

"We are the guardians of sound. Each tape is a rebellion, a record, a relic."

Core Principles
---------------

We are the quiet collectors of moments that were never meant to be forgotten.
Taping is not just a technical act — it is an emotional one.
Each time we press record, we are making a pact with the future:
that this night, this room, this performance will not vanish into memory.
We do not record for vanity or commerce.
We do it for history.
We do it for the ones who couldn’t be there.
We do it because no one else will.

Music is not just sound. It is experience, and experience resists ownership.
A song on a stage, heard once and never again, is not a product — it’s a living thing.
Our tapes are not bootlegs. They are testaments.
We reject the idea that music must be packaged and sold to be valuable.
Its real value lies in the breath between verses, the roar of the crowd,
the unexpected encore that made the night unforgettable.

Perfection does not interest us.
We embrace the crackle of the mic, the chatter of the crowd, the uneven mix.
These so-called flaws are proof of life — of real sound, in real time, from real places.
The music industry may polish and compress, but we capture reality.
Our recordings are not imitations. They are artifacts.

We are not pirates. We are archivists. Every tape is a cultural record.
We do not sell. We do not profit.
We preserve and share because music was meant to be passed on.
A taper’s goal is not applause, but access — to democratize the stage, to decentralize memory.
Our reward is in knowing that one day, someone will press play and be transported.

We are not chasing recognition. We do not wear credentials.
We work in shadow, often without permission, but always with purpose.
The industry may try to gatekeep, but we slip through.
Every recording is quiet defiance — against loss, against silence, against forgetting.

Taping is personal. It is our ritual, our resistance, our love letter to live music.
We don’t seek followers. We seek fidelity — not in sound quality, but in spirit.
Each archive we build is a home for sound that would otherwise be lost.

We don’t represent all tapers. There is no one voice.
But this is one voice, spoken with care, conviction, and deep affection for the art we protect.
The tape rolls because the moment matters.
